# handwritten_digit_recognition
Handwritten digit recognition based on convolutional neural network using python, opencv and tensorflow.

To infer your image with my trained model,

- Clone or download this repository

- Download and extract mnist_train.zip file

- Run following command,
  
    `python3 mninst_eval.py --image=<PATH_TO_YOUR_IMAGE_FILE>`
 Â 
### Note:
- This model is trained with simple MNIST dataset
- This will work only for single digit fitting in entire image
- Image must contain dark (blackish) text with bright (whitish) background
